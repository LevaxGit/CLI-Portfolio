## 🎨 How to Customize

Everything you need to change is inside the `DATA` object at the top of the `<script>` tag in `index.html`:

```js
const DATA = {
  name: 'Levax',           // your name
  handle: '@notlevax',     // your handle

  bio: [
    'line 1 of your bio',
    'line 2 of your bio',
  ],

  skills: {
    'Category': ['Skill1', 'Skill2'],  // add/remove categories freely
  },

  projects: [
    { name: 'My Project', desc: 'what it does', status: 'WIP' },
    // status can be: 'WIP', 'Done', 'Abandoned rip', whatever
  ],

  contact: [
    { label: 'Telegram', value: '@you', href: 'https://t.me/you' },
    { label: 'Discord',  value: '@you', href: null },  // null = no link
  ],
};
```

### Adding a new command

Find the `COMMANDS` object and add yours:

```js
const COMMANDS = {
  // ... existing commands ...

  mycommand() {
    blank();
    line('whatever you want to print here', 'ok');  // ok = green
    line('this one is yellow', 'warn');
    line('this one is red', 'err');
    line('this one is muted/gray', 'muted');
    blank();
  },
};
```

### Updating the `now` command

Find the `now()` function and edit the lines — this is meant to be updated regularly as you work on new things:

```js
now() {
  line('  Currently building: your project here');
  line('  Currently learning: something cool');
}
```

### Changing colors

Find `:root` in the `<style>` tag and go wild:

```css
:root {
  --green: #39ff14;   /* main accent color */
  --cyan:  #00e5ff;   /* secondary accent */
  --bg:    #0d0d0d;   /* background */
  /* etc */
}
```
